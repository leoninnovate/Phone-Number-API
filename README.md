Phone-Number-API
================

Given a starting internet URL (specified through a REST API call), retrieve the web page for that URL and    -- Find all phone numbers on the page.   -- Find all hyperlinks on the page, and traverse them (down to a configurable depth).    -- For each page traversed do the same operations, i.e. store the phone numbers on that page and traverse the links.


Write a CRUD API that allows to Create, Update and Delete phone numbers from the store.  

 Also write a query API (could be part of the CRUD API above) that will allow a user to determine the following;
 -- Which phone area code is the most common found for the dataset?
 -- Which phone number appears on the most unique pages?
 
Please write the code as production-quality code, including tests. You are free to choose your programming language and toolchain, but we need to be able to run the final result. Include a README if necessary that specifies how to run the program
